# Cooperative-energy-spectrum-sensing
Cooperative spectrum sensing in which number of decisions are combined from various CRs and are sent to fusion centre, it helps us to improve probability of detection because of spatial diversity.
Centralized cooperative spectrum sensing with soft fusion of energy measurements in highly mobile environments. Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection criterion. Three methods: LRT (assuming the instantaneous SNRs at the cognitive radios are known by the fusion center, Generalized LRT (GLRT), Online Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm that jointly estimates the SNRs and detects the presence of primary signals.
