# Cooperative-energy-spectrum-sensing
Centralized cooperative spectrum sensing with soft fusion of energy measurements in highly mobile environments. Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection criterion. Three methods: LRT (assuming the instantaneous SNRs at the cognitive radios are known by the fusion center, Generalized LRT (GLRT), Online Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm that jointly estimates the SNRs and detects the presence of primary signals.
