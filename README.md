# Cooperative-energy-spectrum-sensing
Centralized cooperative spectrum sensing with soft fusion of energy measurements in highly mobile environments. Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection criterion. Two methods: LRT (assuming the instantaneous SNRs at the cognitive radios are known by the fusion center) and Generalized LRT (GLRT).

There are some errors in the code that will be corrected soon.
